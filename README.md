# Movies_ETL

In this project, we took some messy data from a few different sources about movies, cleaned them and joined them together. This challenge reworked the code to operate as a function.

I was unable to sync the ratings.csv file as it is too large for github. I attempted a workaround from a Git Large File Storage add-on but was unable to get it working in my terminal. However, I did successfully create and upload both csv files to SQL and was able to perform the proper queries on both DataFrames.
